WGU C195 Application Scheduler

You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application.
The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices
in Phoenix, Arizona; White Plains, New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England.
The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from.
The database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.
